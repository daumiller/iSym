Objective-C Symitar Library

This started out as part of a project to create a RepGen IDE for OS X, but got shelved as PowerOn 2 details surfaced. It wasn't completed with all of the protocol required for a RepDev compatible IDE, but does have some features missing from PowerIDE's Symitar comm. library. It can currently read and write files, and was even tested able to run basic HTML Wizards natively on OS X. I also believe this code base, especially in the login process, to be more stable and flexible than either PowerIDE or RepDev.
